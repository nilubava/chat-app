# Chat App

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Running

Start a local server:

```
npm start
```

## Developing

Any changes you make to files in the `js/` directory will cause the server to
automatically rebuild the app and refresh your browser.

If at any time you make changes to `data/schema.js`, stop the server,
regenerate `data/schema.json`, and restart the server:

```
npm run update-schema
npm start
```

Changes made to the app.scss file will be processed to app.css file and watch makes sure that its available in the app. But the browser needs to be refreshed to reflect the style changes.
